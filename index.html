<h2 class="section-two__title">About Me</h2>
<p class="section-two__desc">As a final year student in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, I bring a dynamic skill set encompassing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. My portfolio reflects my passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and my dedication to continuous learning and growth.
    With proficiency in front-end development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces that prioritize seamless user experiences. I have a keen eye for design and strive to implement modern design principles to enhance the aesthetic appeal and functionality of my projects.
    Additionally, my expertise in Tailwind CSS allows me to efficiently build responsive and customizable web applications, ensuring optimal performance across various devices and screen sizes. I leverage Tailwind's utility-first approach to streamline development processes and deliver projects with speed and precision.
    On the back-end, I am proficient in Node.js and Express.js, enabling me to develop robust server-side applications and APIs. I have a strong grasp of asynchronous programming and understand how to leverage Node.js's event-driven architecture to build scalable and high-performance applications.
    Moreover, my proficiency in MongoDB empowers me to work with non-relational databases and effectively manage data for diverse applications. I am adept at designing schemas, querying data, and optimizing database performance to support the needs of my projects.
